##Instructions and Navigations

This book is intended for use alongside a computer running Lumberyard. The Lumberyard
Editor is therefore required to fully realize the benefits of this book. Lumberyard can run on
a PC with the following minimum system requirements:
Windows 7 (64-bit) or Windows 10 (64-bit)
8 GB RAM
60 GB Hard Disk
3 GHz quad-core processor
DirectX 11 (DX11) compatible video card with at least 2 GB of video RAM
(VRAM)

At the time of this book’s release, Lumberyard beta 1.5 was the most current version
available. There might be slight differences in user interface components between the
illustrations in this book and the actual Lumberyard interface.
